### Hi there üëã

I'm an AI / Machine Learning based in Poland.

Mostly using **üêç Python & stuff** to build ü§ñ machine learning solutions and bring them to production in a nice manner (aka #MLOps).

Trying to help Data Scientist to focus on science by proper tooling preparation and knowledge sharing about code development in data science area.

Huge fan of smart automation. From small ones (like on my computer) till the big ones, like end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines.
